== Terms and Definitions

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

Abstract Test Suite (ATS)* – A set of testable assertions about the functionality of a standard, which an implementation must support in order to achieve compliance to the standard. ATS are based on the conformance clauses defined in the standard.

*Compliance* – A state of a specific software product, which implements an OGC Standard and has passed the Compliance Testing Evaluation.

*Compliance and Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE)* – The same as Compliance Testing Program.

*Conformance* – A standard's "abstract conformance" to Standards Packages for that standard (see ISO 19105:2000 Geographic information - Conformance and Testing at http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26010 ).

*Candidate Organization* – An organization that has made, or intends to make, an application for compliance testing.

*Candidate Product* – A particular product version that has been submitted for compliance testing by a Candidate Organization.

*Certification Authority* – The body that certifies that a Candidate Organization meets the requirements to receive a Compliance Certificate—in this case, the Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.

*Compliance Testing Engine* – A software tool use to evaluate compliance of candidate products.

*Compliance Testing Evaluation Procedure* – Set of steps used to evaluate a software product for proper implementation of an OGC standard.

*Compliance Test Package (CTP)* – This includes the ETS, test data sets, and a reference to the Standards Package and TEAM Engine build. This is versioned to represent a particular state of each component (ETS, test data). Note that changes to Test Package components may not necessitate a change in the Standards Package.

*Compliance Testing Language (CTL)* – An XML grammar used for documenting and scripting suites of tests, used by the Compliance Testing Engine. It is the OGC best practice document OGC 06-126.

*Executable Test Suite (ETS)* – A set of code (e.g. Java and CTL) that provides runtime tests for the assertions defined by the ATS. Test data required to do the tests are part of the ETS.

*Implementation* – A computer program that claims to fulfill the requirements defined in a particular OGC Standard.

*Implementation Standard* – A document or set of documents containing a technology specification created and approved by OGC. It may define a service interface, an encoding language, specific message encodings or data formats.

*Licensee* – Organization that has been granted an OGC Certification Trademark License over a implementation software product, which a version has been certified as compliant for a particular version of a standard.

*OGC CITE Subcommittee (SC)* – A sub-committee of the OGC Technical Committee (TC) consisting of OGC Members interested in the Compliance Testing Program. The SC guides the direction and focus of CITE, through its role in reviewing formal motions brought from OGC Members and Staff, and recommending approval by the TC.

*OGC Member* – an organization that is a member in good standing of OGC.

*OGC Planning Committee (PC)* ­– A committee of the OGC consisting of representatives from OGC Principal and Strategic Members. The PC guides the direction and focus of the OGC Specification Program, through its role in approving formal motions brought from the OGC TC.

*OGC Staff*—individuals employed directly by OGC or seconded to OGC by its Strategic Members.

*OGC Technical Committee (TC)* – A committee of the OGC consisting of representatives from all OGC member organizations. The TC develops standards, specifications, and best practices, subject to approval by the OGC Planning Committee.

*OGC Compliance Test Coordinator* *(CTC)* – The OGC staff member responsible to coordinate and manage the operation of the Compliance Testing Program.

*OGC Web Testing Facility ­–* Software used by OGC to check compliance of software to OGC standards. It is available as a web interface. OCG has an official web site for approved official CTPs and a beta web site for beta CTPs.

*Reference Implementation (RI)* – A fully functional, licensed copy of a tested, branded software that has passes the test for an associated conformance class in a version of an Implementation Standard and that is free and publicly available for testing via a web service or download. The RI does not need to pass all the conformance classes within the standard. In most of the cases, the Reference Implementation will pass at least the core and possibly some number of extension conformance classes. Multiple reference implementations can exist for an associated version of an Implementation Standard

*Software Implementation* – The same as Implementation.

*Specification* - A document containing recommendations, requirements and conformance tests for those requirements (source: https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3])

NOTE: This definition is included for completeness. See Clause 5.3 of The Specification Model — A Standard for Modular specifications (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3]). This does not restrict what else a standard may contain, as long as it does contain the three types of element cited.

*Standard* - A specification that has been approved by a legitimate Standards Body (source: https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3])

NOTE: This definition is included for completeness. Standard and specification can apply to the same document. While specification is always valid, standard only applies after the adoption of the document by a legitimate standards organization. The legitimate Standards Bodies for OGC consist of OGC, ISO and any of the other standards bodies accepted and used as a source of normative references by OGC or ISO in their standards. In the normal meaning of the word "standard", there are other conditions that may be required, but this standard has chosen to ignore them in the process of abstraction.

*Standards Package* – A set of documents including the Implementation Standard Revision, all appropriate schemas supporting the Implementation Standard Revision, the conformance clauses, and the ATS. This is versioned to represent a particular state of each component (standard, schemas, conformance clauses).

*Testing Evaluation And Measurement (TEAM) Engine* – An open source software package designed for testing web services and other resources. It executes test scripts written in Compliance Test Language (CTL). It is used at the OGC Web Testing Facility.
