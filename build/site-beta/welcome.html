<h1> <b>Beta</b> OGC Web Testing Facility </h1>

<p>This free "self-service" testing facility can be used by any developer as often as they like to test their implementations of OGC standards. You don't need to be an OGC member, and you will always have unlimited access to this testing facility.</p>

<p>This is the beta  installation that provides the latest test suites, including those that have not yet been finalized. We encourage you to try them out and provide feedback, so that we may finalize them and make them oficial.</p>

<p>The official testing site is available <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/">here</a>. Once your product passes the test in the official testing site, getting your product certified is easy. Visit the <a href=” http://www.opengeospatial.org/compliance”> OGC Compliance web page</a> for more details. If you need help passing the test contact the contact the <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/forum" target="_blank">CITE forum</a>.</p>

<p>We have a need for new tests and for reference implementations. If you want to contribute a reference implementation or if you want to develop OGC tests, please contact the Director of the Compliance Program, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/organization/staff/lbermudez">Luis Bermudez.</a></p>
